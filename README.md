# guitar_chords

Use the Karplus-Strong[1] algorithm to generate raw sound waves for each string pressed against each fret.
Use a list of common chords and the fingering positions for each chord.
Use PyGame to visualise a guitar neck, have the chords listed so they can be chosen.
Have a play button to play the sound for each chord (the sum of the sounds for each fretted string, played with a slight delay to sound more realistic).
